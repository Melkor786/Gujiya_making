    <center><h1><i><b><u>Gujiya</u></b></i></h1></center>
    <p>
        Learn to make the popular Gujiya recipe that is a classic North Indian sweet of crisp,
        flaky pastry filled with khoya (milk solids) and nuts stuffing. Gujia is generally fried<br>
        but in this recipe post, I am sharing both the fried and baked versions. Take your pick
        and enjoy making these traditional sweet for Holi or Diwali festival.</p>
    <h2>What is Gujiya</h2>
    <p>
        Gujiya are crescent shaped filled pastry that are deep fried.<br>
        The traditional gujiya recipe has a filling of sweeetned khoya<br>
        or mawa (milk solids), cardamom and some nuts.</p>
    <p>
        These delish fried pastries resembles the Mexican empanadas.
        In fact gujia are very much popular in North India, especially during the Holi festival.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will get to see many variations of gujiya in the sweet shops during Holi.
        Gujia is made on both Holi and Diwali festivals.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the eve of Holi I make either Puran Poli, Karanji or gujiya.
    </p>
    <h2>Gujiya vs Karanji</h2>
    <p>
        Karanji and gujiya are similar sweets, except for the stuffing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Karanji which is popular in Maharashtra has a stuffing of coconut, poppy seeds, sesame seeds and nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whereas guijiya has a stuffing of khoya or mawa (dried milk solid)with nuts, dry fruits.
        In some variations desiccated coconut is also added. But I do not add coconut to the khoya stuffing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The varied and unique fillings give a completely different taste, texture and flavor to both the gujiya and karanji.
    </p>
    <h2>About Gujiya Recipe</h2>
    <p>
        My gujiya recipe is the traditional North Indian recipe and is made with the stuffing of khoya (mawa), sugar and nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, in a gujia, the outer pastry is made of all-purpose flour. 
        But you can break away from the norm and make the pastry dough with whole wheat flour.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this recipe, I have included half-half of both all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour.
    </p>
    <p>
        I baked some gujiya and fried the rest and have illustrated both the baking and fried methods in the step by step guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        Texture and taste wise the fried gujiya are definitely much better. However for health reasons and to cut down on the fat you can easily bake them when making this gujiya recipe.
